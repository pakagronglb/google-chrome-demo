# Approach
- Create the structure of the web page using different elements of HTML and link the external stylesheet to the HTML document. We have used various font awesome icons, integrated via the CDN link.
- The element <nav> consists of navigation links a sign-in button and the semantic element <main> Includes an image, search input section, buttons section, and a customization element.
- The Universal Selector removes text decoration for all elements. To style the header use various CSS properties like flex layout and adjusts the appearance of navigation links and sign-in buttons. Style the search input container, including the search bar and microphone icon.
- Use Font awesome icons to give the original touch to the template website project and apply CSS styling to make it visually appealing.
- Position the Customize Chrome button at the bottom-right corner of the webpage using position: absolute, adjusting the distances with bottom and right properties.
